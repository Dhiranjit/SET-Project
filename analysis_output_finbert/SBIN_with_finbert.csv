To address that, the government is guaranteeing the security receipts (SRs). RBI also wanted a market determined price discovery; so we have adopted the Swiss challenge method to ensure robust price discovery.""SRs are issued by ARCs to banks during the purchase of bad loans. They are redeemed at the time of recovery of the loans. Under the Swiss challenge method, new bidders are allowed to better an initial bid following which the first bidder is given a chance to either match or improve on the highest bid.
