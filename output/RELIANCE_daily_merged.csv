An e-mail sent to RIL seeking comments from the company and Ambani was not replied to at the time of filing this story.Ambani controls India’s most-valued firm Reliance Industries (RIL), and has set an example by riding against the tide, as he managed to raise funds for the company’s Jio Platforms unit from a clutch of marquee investors amid the worldwide Covid-19 disruption.Since April, RIL has raised more than Rs 170,000 crore, out of which Rs 117,588.45 crore was collected through as many as 11 deals to sell stakes in Jio Platforms to global investors, and another Rs 53,124.20 crore through a rights issue. The company achieved its net debt-free status much before its promised deadline of March 2021.Shares of oil-to-telecom conglomerate RIL have more than doubled from the lows of March, at a time when the coronavirus pandemic spread thick and fast, impacting most businesses across the globe.“Ambani is blessed with immaculate capabilities of perceiving and implementing large-sized businesses, which is resulting in global scale for his business. I will not be surprised if RIL finds a place among the leading companies in the world in terms of market capitalization,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director, KR Choksey Investment Managers.Ambani is now just behind Larry Elison, who has a net worth of $73.4 billion.RankNameNet Worth (in billions)Country1Jeff Bezos$188.2US2Bill Gates$110.7US3Bernard Arnault & family$109.5France4Mark Zuckerberg$90US5Steve Ballmer$74.5US6Larry Ellison$73.4US7Mukesh Ambani$70.1India8Warren Buffett$67.8US9Larry Page$67.7 US10Sergey Brin$66 USSource: Forbes.comMeanwhile, it has been testing times for legendary investor Warren Buffet. Despite a more than 40 per cent rally in US markets, where the legendary investor has most of his investments, Buffett has been the biggest loser of wealth among the world’s biggest billionaires for Calendar 2020.The total wealth of Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has shrunk by about $28.7 billion this year, and making him the eighth richest person in the world. It is the lowest rank on the rich list he has held since at least 2000.Buffett, a proponent of value investing, encourages people to buy and hold stocks forever. However, he himself was forced to offload a number of his big investments in the first quarter of this financial year, when the market was in a free fall.Berkshire Hathaway sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines, as coronavirus stalled travel demand. Berkshire was among the largest investors in the four — American, Delta, Southwest and United.Berkshire posted a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first three months of the year.The decline in Buffet’s net worth is also linked to his philanthropic activities. He donated $2.9 billion worth of Class B shares in his Berkshire Hathaway charity this week, taking his total philanthropic contributions to $37 billion in 14 years.Meanwhile, the surge in the pandemic has enhanced the fortunes of Jeff Bezos, who has been ruling at the top spot as the world’s richest man with a net worth of $188.2 billion, as people resorted to online shopping more than ever due to the lockdown, sending Amazon shares soaring.“New age digital platforms have been seeing a stupendous rise in valuations due to a favourable environment in these uncertain times. We have seen a rise in the fortunes of the tech titans.

Mukesh Ambani to detail post-Covid business plan at AGM NEW DELHI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is likely to announce plans of leveraging recent partnerships with global technology giants like Facebook as well as a vision to maximise oil to chemical conversion at his flagship Reliance Industries' annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, analysts said.Ambani, 63, may at the company's first online AGM also give a sneak preview of his vision for decarbonization of energy molecules to create value-added products with almost no carbon emissions.Strategic direction post-COVID-19 and further details on asset monetisation are key expectations from the 43rd AGM of RIL, analysts said.The AGM is ""expected to report on progress on asset monetisation (INViTs and stake sale in O2C business), more details on strategic partnerships in digital business, growth plans on financial vertical, oil to chemical integration progress and new technologies,"" Morgan Stanley said.Ambani had at the last AGM on August 12, 2019 announced plans to sell stake in RIL's technology venture as well as in its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business to help become net debt-free by March 2021.The net debt-free status has been achieved much ahead of the deadline thanks to Rs 1.18 lakh crore amassed through the sale of 25.24 per cent in Jio Platforms Ltd - the unit that houses India's youngest but largest telecom firm Jio Infocomm and apps - to likes of Facebook, and the country's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore.The sale of a 20 per cent stake in O2C business, which comprises of its twin oil refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat and petrochemical assets, to Saudi Aramco for an asking of USD 15 billion has however dragged on, although RIL has said it is on track.""We expect investor focus to be on asset monetisation details especially on telecom InvITs and Saudi Aramco stake sale; capital allocation and growth strategy post-COVID-19; plans to leverage the partnerships with global technology peers and integrate its retail, digital and financials business; details on oil to chemicals integration and expansion of oil retail and new energy business with BP,"" Morgan Stanley said.Over the past three years, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani focussed on de-leveraging, asset monetisation and strategic direction for various business lines.The 2017 AGM highlight was 1:1 bonus issue, the launch of JioPhone with free voice calls and energy assets monetisation while 2018 AGM focused on O2C integration, integration of Jio and offline retail stores and transitioning into a technology platform. The 2019 AGM highlight was the end of the telecom investment cycle, de-leveraging in 18 months and telecom and retail listing in 5 years.Proceeds from the stake sales in Jio Platforms along with the Rs 53,124 crore raised in a rights issue in June and from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its fuel retail network to BP last summer for Rs 7,000 crore, will help the company become net debt-free, Reliance announced last month, once the promised funds come in (75 per cent of the funds from the rights issue will come in next year).Goldman Sachs said the focus of the AGM is expected to be largely on product launches around RIL's partnership with Facebook potentially ranging from integration of JioMart with WhatsApp, additional colour on payments business and launch of a large product ecosystem (Super App) where Jio could integrate its services with WhatsApp.""We also expect additional colour on their vision to maximise oil to chemical conversion (to over 70 per cent) to create an annuity-like cash flow, potentially leveraging its proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking process and through a potential strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" it said.In the past, RIL has talked about 500 million customers being within its reach. Jio currently has a base of around 388 million subscribers. ""We will look for any further colour on Jio's strategy to bring the next 100 million into the fold,"" it said.Last year, RIL announced plans to reach 20 million homes and 15 million businesses for its Jio?ber product (timeline were unspeci?ed). As per TRAI data, Jio had less than a million subscribers for this product as of February 2020.RIL at the last AGM stated that Jio is already a software company, and had invested in 14 startups until then. ""We will look for potential colour on the monetisation of its existing internet platforms (music, video, and news apps), and potential foray into any newer verticals,"" it said.In the 2019 AGM, RIL had outlined its ambition to be in the top 20 global retailers in the next ?ve years. Following the recent launch of JioMart, the management is expected to provide more colour on the path to achieve this ambition.Goldman Sachs said it expects management to provide greater insights into the strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco and how that could ?t into their ambition of an industry-leading oil to the chemical platform with over 70 per cent conversion of oil into petrochemicals.BofA Securities said of the five key initiatives announced in last AGM, RIL completed the strategic stake sale of Jio, petro-retail, and moved to zero net debt.
